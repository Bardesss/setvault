**Self-hosted vault for DJ live sets.** Upload FLAC/WAV/MP3 or rip from
YouTube / SoundCloud / Mixcloud / Internet Archive / Bandcamp, and get waveforms,
loudness-normalized audio, time-coded tracklists, enriched metadata, comments,
per-user RSS feeds, an embeddable player, and an installable PWA.

> Think **Mixcloud × 1001tracklists × Plex** — but for DJ live sets.

## 🚀 Deploy

One image, two ways to run it. **Prereqs:** Docker 24+, Compose v2, ~2 GB RAM, and disk for your library.

### Quick start (single container) — recommended

The all-in-one image bundles Postgres, Redis, tusd, and a Caddy proxy. Five steps from zero to running:

1. **Install Docker.** [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 24+ with the Compose v2 plugin (Docker Desktop includes both).

2. **Start SetVault:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name setvault -p 1970:1970 \
     -v setvault-data:/data \
     ghcr.io/bardesss/setvault:latest
   ```
   No secrets to set — on first boot it generates its own, runs database migrations, and starts every service under s6-overlay.

3. **Open the app** at **http://localhost:1970** (or `http://<server-ip>:1970`). Allow ~10–20 s on the very first boot while the database initializes.

4. **Create your admin account.** A first-run wizard appears on a fresh install — fill it in and you're logged in.

5. **Back up the `/data` volume.** That single volume holds the database, Redis, and all your media — snapshot it regularly.

That's it — you're ready to upload a set or paste a URL to rip.

**Going past localhost?** Add `-e BASE_URL=https://sets.example.com` and front a TLS proxy so the session cookie is `Secure` — see the **TLS & `BASE_URL`** section below.

**Scripted/headless admin** (instead of the wizard): the bundled CLI reads credentials from the environment so the password never hits the command line —
```bash
docker exec -e ADMIN_EMAIL='you@example.com' -e ADMIN_PASSWORD='min-12-chars' \
  setvault python -m setvault_web.create_admin
```
It's idempotent (promotes an existing user to admin; re-running is safe).

### Quick start with Docker Compose

Prefer a declarative file you can version and re-apply? Same bundled image, via Compose:

1. **Install Docker** with the Compose v2 plugin (see step 1 above).

2. **Create `compose.yaml`** in an empty directory:
   ```yaml
   services:
     setvault:
       image: ghcr.io/bardesss/setvault:latest
       ports:
         - "1970:1970"
       volumes:
         - setvault-data:/data
       restart: unless-stopped
       # Internet-facing? Uncomment and front a TLS proxy:
       # environment:
       #   BASE_URL: "https://sets.example.com"
   volumes:
     setvault-data:
   ```

3. **Start it:** `docker compose up -d` (run from that directory).

4. **Open** http://localhost:1970 and complete the first-run wizard.

5. **Update later:** `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` — migrations run automatically on start.

Back up the `setvault-data` volume the same as above. (The repo also ships ready-made compose files under `infra/docker/` if you'd rather clone it.)

### External datastores (compose)

For managed/shared Postgres + Redis or independent scaling — set `DATABASE_URL` and/or
`REDIS_URL` and the matching bundled datastore stays off:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set BASE_URL + DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL
docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml up -d
```

### TLS & the `BASE_URL` rule

The session cookie's `Secure` flag is derived from your `BASE_URL` scheme, so set it to match how you serve the app:

- **Public internet** — terminate TLS at a reverse proxy and set `BASE_URL=https://your-host`. The only safe mode for a public origin.
- **VPN / LAN-only** — set `BASE_URL=http://10.x.x.x:1970`; the `http://` scheme drops `Secure` so login persists. Never expose port `1970` to the internet on an `http://` URL.
- **Tailscale serve** — point `BASE_URL` at the `https://…ts.net` name; the cookie is `Secure` automatically.

> ⚠️ **External mode:** keep `1970` behind a reverse proxy that strips client-supplied
> `X-Forwarded-For`. Direct exposure lets clients spoof those headers and defeat
> rate-limiting and the `Secure`-cookie logic. Scope trusted upstreams with `SETVAULT_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`.

> **Don't rewrite the HTML:** the strict CSP pins the app's inline script by hash, so a
> proxy/CDN that minifies HTML or injects scripts (e.g. Cloudflare Auto Minify or Rocket Loader)
> breaks hydration — a blank page. Forward the HTML untouched; TLS termination alone is fine.

> **Bundled-mode caveat:** the embedded Postgres is pinned to **PG 18** and its data dir is tied to
> that major version. Use external mode (or dump/restore) for rolling major upgrades. Bundled mode is homelab-grade.

### Images & signatures

`ghcr.io/bardesss/setvault:latest` — `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`. **Pin an explicit tag in production.**
Every release is signed with cosign (keyless) and ships a CycloneDX SBOM on the GitHub Release:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/bardesss/setvault:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/Bardesss/setvault/.github/workflows/docker.yml@.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Config is via environment variables (`.env`). **Bundled mode needs zero required vars** —
secrets are generated on first boot and `BASE_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:1970`.
External mode needs `BASE_URL` plus `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`. The essentials:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | external only | Public URL (emails, RSS, embeds). Use your `https://` URL when internet-facing. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | auto | Signs cookies + HMAC URLs. Generated if unset; rotating invalidates all sessions. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | auto (bundled) | Generated if unset; also feeds the synthesized `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL` | optional | Set to use external datastores; unset = bundled. |
| `SETVAULT_VERSION` | optional | Image tag — **pin in production** (default floats on `latest`). |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | optional | Container user/group for bind-mount permissions (default `1000`). |

`SETVAULT_DEV_SEED` enables a public test-only seed endpoint — **never set it in production**.
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) / `.env.example` for the full list (paths, ports, advanced proxy flags).

## 🔄 Upgrading

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d   # migrations run automatically on start
```

Read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) before any major/minor bump. Notably, bundled mode moved to
**Postgres 18** in `v0.6.0`: a PG 16 data dir is not compatible — back up on 16, start `v0.6.0`+ on a
fresh data dir, and restore (see below).

## 💾 Backup & restore

The admin backup endpoint streams a tarball of a fresh `pg_dump` + your media:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o setvault-backup-$(date +%F).tar \
  -b 'session=...' -H 'X-CSRF-Token: ...' https://your-instance/api/admin/backup
```

Restore is the inverse via the bundled CLI. It is **destructive** and refuses to run without `--yes`:

```bash
docker cp setvault-backup.tar setvault:/data/restore.tar
docker exec setvault python -m setvault_web.restore /data/restore.tar --yes
```

## 🛠 Local development

```bash
# Backend (FastAPI + uvicorn):
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn setvault_web.main:app --reload --port 1970

# Frontend (SvelteKit, hot reload):
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev -- --port 4173
```

`infra/docker/compose.dev.yml` runs Postgres + Redis + tusd locally for the backend to talk to.

### Build & run the image from source

To test the full bundled image from your checkout instead of pulling `ghcr.io/bardesss/setvault`:

```bash
# Build the all-in-one image (SvelteKit + Python + s6, multi-stage)
docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile -t setvault:local .

# Run it exactly like the published image
docker run --rm -p 1970:1970 -v setvault-data:/data \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:1970 setvault:local
```

Then open `http://localhost:1970`. To test under Compose, point the service's `image:` at `setvault:local`. Rebuild after changing any source (frontend, backend, or `infra/docker/`).

## 🏛 Architecture

```
browsers ─▶ web :1970 ─┬─▶ tusd /uploads
                       └─▶ worker (RQ) ─▶ watcher (filesystem events)
                                │
            Postgres 18 ◀───────┼───────▶ Redis 7 · ffmpeg + fpcalc
```

- **`apps/web`** — FastAPI + bundled SvelteKit
- **`apps/worker`** — RQ worker (transcode / waveform / enrichment) + `watchdog` watcher
- **`packages/core`** — SQLAlchemy models, services, RQ job entrypoints
- **`packages/providers`** — metadata provider plugins (MusicBrainz / Discogs / AcoustID)
- **`frontend/`** — SvelteKit source (built into the web image); design language in `frontend/design/`
- **`infra/`** — Alembic migrations + Dockerfiles + compose stacks

## 🔒 Security

- Argon2 hashing · pure-ASGI CSRF + security-headers middleware · strict CSP/HSTS · HMAC-signed short-TTL URLs
- SSRF allowlist on URL-rip ingest · Redis rate-limiting on login + URL-rip · exact-pinned `yt-dlp`
- `no-new-privileges` + `cap_drop: ALL` on every container · audit log of every state-changing admin action

> **Defense-in-depth:** `yt-dlp` follows redirects without an internal-IP guard, so firewall
> container egress to block the cloud metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`) and RFC-1918 / link-local
> ranges. This stops a redirect-based SSRF even if it slips past the host allowlist.

## 📋 Status

Shipped through the **7.x "ingest power tools"** line (URL rip, multi-source search, monitored entities);
casting, Subsonic API, smart playlists, and OIDC are on the roadmap. Each phase ships as a PR with
conventional commits driving the CHANGELOG — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history and what's next.
